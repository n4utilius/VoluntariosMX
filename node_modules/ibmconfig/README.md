ibmconfig module for IBM Bluemix
===
 
ibmconfig module provides a consistent and easy way to access IBM Bluemix environment objects. With 
this module, user code works both on Bluemix and on local environment.

## Declare ibmconfig as dependency in your package.json.

```
{
   "author": "abc",
   "dependencies": {
      "ibmconfig": "*" 
   },
   ......
}
```

## Require and initialize ibmconfig module.

```
	// applicationId is the appGUID of your applicaiton
	var applicationId = "xxx";	
	var config = require('ibmconfig');	
	config.initializeSDK(applicationId);
	// print all variables provided by ibmconfig
	console.log(JSON.stringify(config));
```

## Local development and debugging

When developing and debugging your application in local environment, ibmconfig module provides access to 
IBM Bluemix environment objects of your application, e.g., VCAP_SERVICES, VCAP_APPLICATION etc. To achieve this, 
ibmconfig module needs to know where your Cloud Foundry token is. 

Create a debug.json file in the root directory of your application, and config the content as below.

For Cloud Foundry CLI v5:
```
	{
	   "cloudFoundryTokensFilePath": "C:\\Users\\username\\.cf\\tokens.yml"
	}
```	

For Cloud Foundry CLI v6:
```	
	{
	   "cloudFoundryTokensFilePath": "C:\\Users\\username\\.cf\\config.json"
	}
```	

You may need to use Cloud Foundry CLI to target and login to IBM Bluemix to make sure your token exists and is 
refreshed on your local system.
